## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the User Guide of **Homerce**!


Are you an independent home-based beauty salon owner, scrambling between your calendar, client contacts, 
and notebook to keep track of all your appointments, revenue and expenses? 
Do you spend hours tabulating all your revenue and expenses just to get an idea of how your business is doing?
Fret not, our application, Homerce, will reduce the hassle of managing your business and save your valuable time. 
Homerce is an all-in-one application that helps home-based beauty salon owners consolidate their business details - 
such as their appointments, revenue and expenses - into a single application. 

The application uses a Command Line Interface (CLI); this means that you operate the application by typing commands 
into a Command Box. If you are fast at typing, you can operate the application faster than other Graphical User Interface 
(GUI) applications; GUI applications allow users to interact with the application through graphical icons such as buttons.

## 5. FAQ

**Q**: How do I create a Revenue in Homerce? <br>
**A**: Unfortunately, Homerce does not allow you to directly create a revenue. A Revenue will only be created when an appointment
is marked as done.

**Q**: What is the `isFixed` parameter in the Expense Tracker for? <br>
**A**: Marking an expense as 'Fixed' indicates to Homerce that the particular expense is fixed and recurs every month. Homerce
will automatically add the same expense to your list of expenses every month. 

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: By default, Homerce saves all your data in a folder named `data` in the same directory as the application. 
You can copy and transfer the data folder into the same directory as Homerce on your other computer and Homerce will automatically load your data for you.
