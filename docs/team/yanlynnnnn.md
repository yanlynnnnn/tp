## Project: GrAB3
GrAB3 is an all in one planner application that provides a simple way for university students to stay ahead of their
busy schedules. The student interacts with the application using a command-line interface (CLI).

## Overview
This portfolio aims to document the contributions that I have made to the GrAB3 project. In this project, our team - GrAB3,
will enhance a basic CLI Address Book 3 (AB3) and repurpose it to create our application: GrAB3.
