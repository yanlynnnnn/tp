## 1. **Introduction**

**Homerce** is a desktop business management application meant for home-based beauty salon owners who want to consolidate all
the information related to their business, such as upcoming appointments, their list of clients, as well as profits recorded.
It focuses on the Command Line Interface (CLI) while providing users with a simple and clean Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Thus, the main interaction with **Homerce**. will be done through commands.

The features of Homerce include:
* Keeping track of existing/new clients.
* Scheduling of upcoming appointments with clients.
* Recording of revenue from services provided.
* Recording of business-related expenses.
* Calculation of business profit.

The purpose of this Developer Guide is to help you understand the design and implementation of **Homerce**,
so that you can get started on your contributions to **Homerce**.

## 2. **Setting up**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

## 3. **Design**

This section will help you learn more about the design and structure of Homerce.

### 3.1 Architecture

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given below explains the high-level design of the Homerce. 

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

The table below gives an overview of each component in Homerce. More details about each component can be found in the following subsections.

| Component | Overview |
|-----------|----------|
|**`Main`**| Has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). <br> It is responsible for: <br> 1. At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other. <br> 2. At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.|
|**`Commons`**|Represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.|
|**`UI`**|The UI of the App.|
|**`Logic`**|The command executor.|
|**`Model`**|Holds the data of the App in memory.|
|**`Storage`**|Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.|

Each of the four components - `UI`, `Logic`, `Model`, and `Storage`,
* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point. For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deletecli 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI Component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 3.3 Logic Component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 3.4 Model Component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Client` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Client` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 3.5 Storage Component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6 Common Classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 4. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 List Managers

Homerce allows the user to manage different essential lists for his or her home-based beauty salon.

The different types of lists include:
1. Appointments list
2. Clients list
3. Services list

All these lists are managed by a `ListManager` which support basic [CRUD](#appendix-e-glossary) operations and some
additional operations depending on the different types of `ListManager`s. Additional operations include operations such as
`sort`. The term *item* will be used to refer to an element stored in a list.

Common commands for all list managers:
* `add` - Creates a new list item
* `edit` - Modifies an existing list item
* `delete` - Removes an existing item from the list
* `list` - Shows all items in the list
* `find` - Searches for item(s) in the list
* `clear` - Removes all the items in the list

#### 4.1.1 Rationale 

When running a home-based beauty salon, there are many things that the user needs to manage. The 3 lists stated above
are essential to every home-based beauty salon. That is why there are `ListManager`s to help the user manage the 3
lists so that they can run their home-based beauty salon effectively and efficiently. 

#### 4.1.2 Current Implementation

In this section, we will explain the structure of a `ListManager`.
As mentioned in this section's overview, the term *item* refers to an element stored in a list.

The `ListManager` contains a `UniqueList` which is a data structure that stores all the *items* of a list. The 
`UniqueList` uses Java's generics and contains items that implement the `UniqueListItem` interface. The uniqueness of
an *item* in the list is checked using the `isSame()` method of the `UniqueListItem` interface.

The `ListManager` also implements the `ReadOnlyManager` interface which has the `getList()` method. The `getList()` method
returns an `ObservableList` of *items*. For instance, `ServiceManager` implements `ReadOnlyServiceManager`. The
`ObservableList` of *items* allow listeners to track changes when they occur and reflect these changes to the graphical
user interface.

The following class diagram models the structure of the `ListManager`.

![Class diagram for list manager](images/ListManagerClassDiagram.png) 

*Figure 1. Structure of `ListManager`*

#### 4.1.3 Design Consideration 

**Aspect: Implementation of a `ListManager`**
|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Extract the common functionality of the <br> 3 `ListManager`s into one generic `UniqueList` class.<br> The `UniqueList` class is used as the base data structure <br> and all 3 `ListManager`s build additional functionality on top of it. | Makes use of the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle which guards against duplication of information and minimizes repeated code.| All `ListManager`s will have dependencies on `UniqueList`. Implementation of all `ListManager`s will require `UniqueList` to be finished implementing first.|
| **Option 2** <br> Do not extract any common functionalities.| Each member can begin working on their own implementation of `ListManager` immediately and independently as there are no dependencies on a common `UniqueList`. | Violates DRY principle and results in a lot of repeated code and functionality|

Reason for choosing option 1:
* Follow good coding standards by applying design principles such as the DRY principle.
* Reduce total man-hours required to create each `ListManager` once the common dependency of `UniqueList` has been created.

### 4.2 List Trackers 

Homerce allows the user to keep track of different lists that stores the financial details of his or her home-based beauty salon.

The different types of lists include:
1. Expenses list
2. Revenue list

All these lists tracked by a `ListTracker`. The `ListTracker` for an expenses list will have additional `add`, `edit`,
and `delete` operations. The term *item* will be used to refer to elements stored in a list.

Common commands for all list managers:
* `sort` - Sorts the list by the given order
* `list` - Shows all items in the list
* `find` - Searches for item(s) in the list
* `clear` - Removes all the items in the list
* `breakdown` - Categorizes and gives an overview of the items in the list

#### 4.2.1 Rationale 

When running a home-based beauty salon, it is important to keep track of the financials of the business. The revenue and
expenses information are essential to any home-based beauty salon. That is why there are `ListTrackers`s to help the user manage 
the revenue and expenses lists so that they can keep track of their home-based beauty salon's profitability conveniently. 

#### 4.2.2 Current Implementation

In this section, we will explain the structure of a `ListTracker`.
As mentioned in this section's overview, the term *item* refers to an element stored in a list.

The `ListTracker` contains a `NonUniqueList` which is a data structure that stores all the *items* of a list. The 
`NonUniqueList` uses Java's generics and contains items that implement the `NonUniqueListItem` interface. 

The `ListTracker` also implements the `ReadOnlyTracker` interface which has the `getList()` method. The `getList()` method
returns an `ObservableList` of *items*. For instance, `RevenueTracker` implements `ReadOnlyRevenueTracker`. The
`ObservableList` of *items* allow listeners to track changes when they occur and reflect these changes to the graphical
user interface.

The following class diagram models the structure of the `ListTracker`.

![Class diagram for list tracker](images/ListTrackerClassDiagram.png)

*Figure 2. Structure of `ListTracker`*

#### 4.2.3 Design Consideration 

**Aspect: Separating a `ListManager` from a `ListTracker`**
|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> Make use of a `ListManager` to keep track of expenses and revenue as well | Reduces repeated code for certain functionalities such as `list`, `find` and `clear`. | A `ListManager` depends on a `UniqueList` which ensure that all *items* in the list are unique. However, revenue and expense entries may not be unique. This means that revenue and expense *item* entries can not be properly represented using a `ListManager`.|
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Create a new `ListTracker` to keep track of expenses and revenue | Allows for a proper representation of non unique revenue and expense items in Homerce. | Some code will be repeated for certain common functionalities amongst `ListManager` and `ListTracker`.|

Reason for choosing option 2:
* Homerce needs to be able to add revenue and expense details for it to track the financials of the home-based beauty salon. This can only be done with a `ListTracker` which allows for non-unique list *items*.
* Using `ListTracker` with a dependency on `NonUniqueList` allows for a different implementation when comparing two *items* in the list.

**Aspect: Implementation of a `ListTracker`**
|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Extract the common functionality of the <br> 3 `ListTracker`s into one generic `NonUniqueList` class.<br> The `NonUniqueList` class is used as the base data structure <br> and both `ListTracker`s build additional functionality on top of it. | Makes use of the Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) principle which guards against duplication of information and minimizes repeated code.| Both `ListTracker`s will have dependencies on `NonUniqueList`. Implementation of both `ListTracker`s will require `NonUniqueList` to be finished implementing first.|
| **Option 2** <br> Do not extract any common functionalities.| Each member can begin working on their own implementation of `ListTracker` immediately and independently as there are no dependencies on a common `NonUniqueList`. | Violates DRY principle and results in a lot of repeated code and functionality|

Reason for choosing option 1:
* Follow good coding standards by applying design principles such as the DRY principle.
* Reduce total man-hours required to create each `ListTracker` once the common dependency of `NonUniqueList` has been created.

### 4.3 Service Manager 

Homerce allows the user to keep track of the services that his or her home-based business provides. The service manager is one of the `ListManager`s elaborated in [section 4.1](#41-list-managers).

#### 4.3.1 Rationale 

The service manager is essential to any home-based business that provides services for its customers. With many services to keep track of, we decided to create
a service manager to assist the user with the process of keeping track of all the services that his or her home-based business provides.

#### 4.3.2 Current Implementation

The current implementation of the service manager allows the user to keep track of a list of services that is provided by the home-based business. Each service
added into the list will have a unique service code to identify it. The service code will be automatically generated by Homerce when the user adds a new
service. 

In this section, we will use the following Activity Diagram to outline the generation of service code when the `addsvc` command of the service manager is executed.

![Activity diagram for service manager addsvc command](images/AddServiceActivityDiagram.png)

*Figure 3. Workflow of a `addsvc` command*

When the user enters the `addsvc` command to add a new service, the user input command undergoes the same command parsing as described in 
[Section 3.3 Logic Component](#33-logic-component). During the execution of `AddServiceCommand`, Homerce will check the existing list
of services and all the service codes assigned to it. From the existing list of service codes, Homerce will then generate the
next smallest service code ranging from "SC000" to "SC999". For example, if Homerce already has an existing list of services with
service codes "SC000", "SC001", and "SC005", the next service code generated during the execution of `AddServiceCommand` would be
"SC002".

The following steps will describe the execution of the `AddServiceCommand` in detail, assuming that no errors are encountered.
1. When the `execute()` method of the `AddServiceCommand` is called, the `ModelManager`'s `getFilteredServiceList()` method is called.
2. The `ModelManager` will return a list of services provided by Homerce to the `AddServiceCommand`.
3. The `ServiceCodeGenerator` will use the list of services provided and call the `generateServiceCode()` method.
4. The `ServiceCodeGenerator` will return a unique service code, which is assigned to the service being added.
5. The `Model` is updated to include the newly added service by calling the `addService()` method of the `ModelManager`, which proceeds to call the `addService()` method of the `ServiceManager`.
6. The `Ui` component will detect this change and update the GUI.
7. Assuming that the above steps are all successful, the `AddServiceCommand` will then create a `CommandResult` object and return the result.

The following Sequence Diagram summarises the aforementioned steps. 

![Sequence diagram for addsvc command](images/AddServiceSequenceDiagram.png)

*Figure 4. Execution of an `addsvc` command*

#### 4.3.2 Design Consideration

**Aspect: Identifying each service with a unique service code**
|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> Omit the use of service codes to identify a service. | Arguably more user-friendly to identify services by its title instead of a service code. | Unable to uniquely identify services, resulting in complications when executing commands which require services. <br> For example adding an appointment for a service "Manicure" when there are two "Manicure" services provided by Homerce but with different prices and durations. |
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Tag each service with a unique service code. | Allows users to easily identify services uniquely. | Limits the number of services that can be added to Homerce depending on the format of the service code |

Reason for choosing option 2:
* It is important for users to be able to uniquely identify services the user may want to have multiple services with the same title, but with different prices or durations.
* The current format of a service code allows for 1000 unique services to be created since service codes are recycled when a service is deleted. This would be more than sufficient all home-based businesses to add all the services that they provide.

**Aspect: Service code generation**
|              | **Pros**   | **Cons** |
| -------------|-------------| -----|
| **Option 1** <br> Allow the user to select his or her own service code. | Gives the user more freedom to select a service code that suits the user's liking. | Unnecessary burden for the user to keep track of and select an unique service codes for each new service to be created.|
| **Option 2 (current choice)** <br> Automatically generate a service code for an added service. | Easier to ensure consistency in the format of service codes. <br> Relieves the burden of tracking and maintaining service codes from the user. | Service codes generated may not be intuitive for the user to easily remember. |

Reason for choosing option 2:
* If the user's home-based business has many services, automatic generation of service codes will provide a more seamless and convenient process when adding new services.
* The user can find services by title to determine it's unique service code, allowing the user to quickly identify a service's service code.

### Others

*{More to be added}*

## **Appendix D: Non-Functional Requirements**

* System Requirements:
    * Homerce should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
    * Homerce should be optimized for keyboard input and can function without the use of a mouse.
      However, a mouse would improve the user experience.
    * The computer running the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) should have sufficient disk space to
      accommodate the user's data stored in the system. It should also have sufficient RAM
      and CPU power to run the JVM smoothly.
* Performance Requirements:
    * Homerce should be able to start up and load existing the user's stored data sufficiently fast (< 10s).
    * Context switching / menu navigation through the use of either text commands or button clicks should be sufficiently fast (< 10s).
* Usability:
    * Homerce should be user-friendly for any client who can use a computer and does not require prior technical knowledge.
    * The user interface of Homerce should look intuitive and simple to navigate. It should not look cluttered with too many panels.
* Reliability:
    * Homerce should not crash in the event of incorrect user input - this should be handled safely with exceptions.
* Scalability:
    * Homerce should be able to handle thousands of appointments, clients, expenses and all other recorded entries by a user.
     No expansion of hardware capabilities or software modifications should be required.

## **Appendix E: Glossary**

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
* **JVM**: Java Virtual Machine - Java code that is compiled is run in the virtual machine.
* **CRUD**: In computer programming, create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions of persistent storage
